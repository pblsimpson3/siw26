            <p><strong>Dear 21st Century Friends,</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Welcome to 1646! More than a year ago our family, crossing the vast Atlantic Ocean, arrived here in the New World, at the Village of Hammersmith, located in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Our father, William, signed on with recruiters or agents of the "Company of Undertakers of the Iron Works in New England". The "Company of Undertakers" was formed by the Honorable Mr. John Winthrop, Jr., son of Governor John Winthrop, student of metallurgy and founder of significant ore deposits in this area. Young Winthrop had been offered incentives by the Massachusetts government to establish an iron works here in the New World, and through his efforts men and materials were brought from England to start iron making in Massachusetts.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Father is skilled in the blacksmith trade and the making of iron. Like many other young men with families, talented artisans from England and Wales, Father has signed on for seven years of service to the "Undertakers" as an indentured servant (a person who agrees to work for another person without pay for a certain length of time). We, his family, have accompanied him. After working off his contract, Father, like the others, will have the opportunity to become an independent worker, free to negotiate his terms of employment.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>We invite you to spend a day with us and visit the Iron Works. Come…Travel back in time. Experience life in 1646. Experience the Saugus Iron Works!</strong></p>
